Introductory talk for node building
===================================

For a dedicated node-building tutorial, a technical introduction is needed before letting the students loose on the software. The talk linked here was written by Guy Rixon for a tutorial at Innsbruck early in 2013.

The same talk is available in several formats. The Keynote version is the original.

.. _extended-talk:

An extended talk to introduce VAMDC to new users
================================================

The talk will be presented as a slide-set with speaker notes. The actual slides are not made yet, but I [#]_ expect them to be drawn from the many summary-talks that we have given over the last three years.

I propose to cover the following topics:

* The motivations for VAMDC.
* The history of the two projects.
* The parties involved in the project.
* (In outline) the query-response paradigm and how the data extracts are generated on demand.
* The list of databases currently connected, and those in preparation.
* The concept that the databases are separate nodes, not homogenised.
* The further concept that the VAMDC system makes the disparate data interoperable, despite differences in databases. 
* The VAMDC portal as a generic UI.
* The expectation that user groups will gradually migrate to custom portals or applications that access the data nodes directly.
* Examples of topic specific portals and app: CDMS web pages, Specview application.
* Scriptability: simple scripts that use VAMDC and how user groups might write their own.
* Taverna and MyExperiment as an alternative to transitional scripting.
* Facilities and support for connecting larger applications to VAMDC (Specview again as example, since it uses the new UI-library).
* How tool-writers can engage with SUP@VAMDC.
* How data-providers can engage with SUP@VAMDC.
* Evolution of the standards, including the origin of XSAMS. Need for distinct versions of VAMDC system; implication on software maintenance.
* Probable evolution of VAMDC system.
* Possible evolution of VAMDC consortium.

The talk should, I suggest, last about 40 minutes, so each topic can only have one or two slides and there will be no technical detail.

If these are *not* the right topics, I welcome guidance on what should be included.

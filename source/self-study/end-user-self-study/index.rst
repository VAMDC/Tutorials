This tutorial is for scientists intending to use VAMDC data in their own research, and it consists in a series of exercises. In each exercise, there is an introduction, some tasks for you to perform on the VAMDC system and notes on the expected results.

Some exercises do not tell you exactly how to do each step: that information is in the VAMDC user guides which are separate documents. You should use the links from the exercise pages into the guides to find the details.

You can work through the exercise at your own pace. Feel free to skip exercises that do not interest you. However, within a given exercise you should attempt all the tasks in order as some tasks depend on the results of previous tasks.

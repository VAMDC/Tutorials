Self-study course for data providers
====================================

A `quick-start guide <http://www.vamdc.eu/documents/nodesoftware/quickstart.html>`_ is available for people who wish to add their own data to VAMDC. By reading this briefing and then following the detailed instructions in the `node-software manual <http://www.vamdc.org/documents/nodesoftware/index.html>`_, data-providers can learn about the VAMDC technology at their own pace.

There are also videos are for self-paced study, covering roughly the same procedures as the quick-start guide and node-software manual.

The videos currently linked here are prototypes by Thomas Marquart. The final videos will have clearer narration, will be engineered to display properly on Macs (currently the picture is lost), and will be hosted on YouTube. Please do not circulate or publicise these prototypes.

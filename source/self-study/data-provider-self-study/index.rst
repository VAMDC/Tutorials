Self-study course for data providers
====================================

The screen-cast videos below are a complement to the existing documentation.
They show how to get a new data node running. Before starting, you should have
read the `quick-start guide
<http://www.vamdc.eu/documents/nodesoftware/quickstart.html>`_ for people who
wish to add their own data to VAMDC.

Once you decide you want an own VAMDC data node, it is time to look into the `node-software manual
<http://www.vamdc.org/documents/nodesoftware/index.html>`_ which contains all information covered below, and more.

The following recorded terminal sessions put into practice these instructions and cover the involved steps in a concise walk-through.

A few remarks before you start watching:

* A basic familiarity with the linux command line is a prerequisite for understanding. Basic knowledge in the Python programming language is recommended.
* The videos are not "video" per se, but recorded text. This allows you, for example, to copy and paste from what you see.
* There are controls for play/pause and slower/faster playback.
* Audio commentary is available through YouTube, see `this playlist <http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnvixjx1Po3SoCZM7PEQ6oJBxEvZag4gg>`_.
